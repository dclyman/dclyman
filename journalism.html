					<h3>UCSB's LGBTQ Community in Turmoil After Controversial Firing of LGBTQ Center Leader</h3>
					<h4>BY: DYLAN LYMAN // Nov. 20, 2017</h4>
					<p><em>A bulletin board filled with announcements for “Queer and Trans Meditation,”</em> “LGBTQ+ Orgs and Clubs,” and calendars of activities by the campus LGBTQ community, greets people entering the third floor of the Student Resource Building. The Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) is tucked away on an otherwise inconspicuous level.</p>
					<p>The hallway to the RCSGD had a whiteboard with the question, “What are your intentions for this week?” Answers to the question included, “Catch up on readings,” “Wrap-up unfinished projects,” “Call my grandma.” </p>
					<p>The room of the RCSGD was filled with posters, books, nick-knacks, and smells of incense. Two student staffers sat at the front desk talking gossip. Other students lounged in various couches and seats talking or studying with one another. A print-out of a news article announcing the election of Danica Roem, one of the first openly transgender persons to be elected to a US state legislature sat among pamphlets for campus support centers, Planned Parenthood, and other information. </p>
					<p>The Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity provides a safe space for sexually and gender diverse individuals and acts like other study and hang out spaces around campus. It is a welcoming space filled with friendly people, while also providing a quiet spot to study and get away from the chaos of campus. </p>
					<p>“Everybody was always welcoming. They would be understanding. I remember confiding in one of the staff members,” says Yesenia Limon, current human resources staff at the university and class of 2014 alumnus, who identifies as queer. “I felt like I belonged there. People there might be going through the same feelings and struggle. It was a place to recharge my energy.” </p>
					<p>The RCSGD has been undergoing many changes and overcoming many challenges in the past month. It has received a ‘yes’ vote on two resolutions to gain its own freestanding building, doubled funds and separation from the Women, Gender and Sexual Equity Department (WGSE) by the Associated Students Senate. </p>
					<p>Sexual and gender inclusivity on UC Santa Barbara’s campus has made large leaps and bounds recently. The recent news concerning the RCSGD, brings attention to the LGBTQ community on campus and how the campus is making moves to become more inclusive to an increasingly sexually and gender diverse student population. </p>
					<p>“The RCGSD resolution tells the administration that we aren’t messing around,” says Felipe Recinos, a fifth-year Environmental Studies major, current parliamentarian of the Student Senate, and proxy co-chair for the Women’s Commission. </p>
					<p>The progress for the RCSGD hasn’t been without some pitfalls. A meeting of the WGSE and RCSGD staff members was held on November 17 to discuss the resolutions and saw a demand for the resignation of the current RCSGD executive director Christine Dolan and assistant dean of the WGSE, Kim Equinoa, after Ale Muro, RCSGD associate director was fired and escorted out by a plainclothes police officer, <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2017-11-17/resource-center-for-sexual-and-gender-diversity-receives-approval-for-new-building-doubled-budget-after-university-signs-demands/"><span>as reported by the Daily Nexus.</span></a></p>
					<p>Among the changes to the RCSGD, the Division of Student Affairs has stated they will roll out a new mandatory online course on diversity and inclusion for new students coming to UC Santa Barbara starting Fall 2018. </p>
					<p>“[The new course] is a 30-minute training to help people understand the intricacies of gender,” says Nathaniel Burke, coordinator of Student Affairs’ Campus Climate and Inclusion Initiatives. “It is being developed by three UC campuses: UCSB, UC Davis and UCSC. <a href="https://everfi.com/"><span>Everfi</span></a> is developing the content in consultation with students to give feedback on how we should talk about [sexual and gender inclusivity].” </p>
					<p>Burke is a queer identifying alumnus of UC Santa Barbara who graduated in 2011. They hope that the new mandatory program will improve the overall experience for sexually and gender diverse students. </p>
					<p>In a <a href="http://campusclimate.ucop.edu/_common/files/pdf-climate/ucsb-summary.pdf"><span>campus climate survey</span></a> conducted by Rankin & Associates Consulting in 2013, about 12 percent of UC Santa Barbara’s campus community identified as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Queer, Questioning, or Asexual. Also, about 1 percent of the campus community identified as Transgender or genderqueer. </p>
					<p>Some key findings of the survey found that, “84% of the survey respondents were ‘comfortable’/’very comfortable’ with the climate at UC Santa Barbara.” However, out of this number, “White respondents, men, heterosexual respondents, and respondents without disabilities were more likely than their underrepresented peers to feel ‘very comfortable’.” </p>
					<p>The introduction of a new mandatory online course for new students—operating much like the current mandatory courses <a href="http://orientation.sa.ucsb.edu/resources-info/new-student-requirements/ucsb-mandatory-education"><span>Haven and AlcoholEdu</span></a>—is a sign for many current students that the campus is becoming more inclusive of its LGBTQ community. </p>
					<p>“On one hand, I don’t really think that mandatory education programs are an end-all-be-all. I think a lot of gender is a spectrum,” says Lillian Zhou, a fourth-year Environmental Studies and Political Science double major. “Taking an online course is not necessarily going to make you be like ‘oh now I accept transgender.’ But it is a signal to [LGBTQ people and others] that this is a school that is able to make this distinction.” </p>
					<p>Many members of the UC Santa Barbara LGBTQ community say that what they want to see is more visibility and knowledge within the dominant groups on campus. Alumni say that they have seen more visibility and consciousness from the heterosexual majority in recent years. </p>
					<p>“The little things matter so much. I remember distinctly the fear and doubt that language in passing would impose on me,” says Miles Ashlock, assistant dean of the Office of Student Life, which oversees campus organizations and leadership development, class of 2006 alumnus, who identifies as gay. </p>
					<p>“The Student Resource Center did exist. RCSGD was in the UCEN. There was one staff member. There was fewer organizations and fewer people, less visibility,” Ashlock recalls from his time as an undergraduate. “Looking back, I didn’t see a lot of trans visibility.” </p>
					<p>Ashlock’s office, the Office of Student Life, oversees the Student Resources Building and its constituent departments including the Women, Gender and Sexual Equity Department which runs the Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity. </p>
					<p>“[The Center] was recently fully staffed. One person is no longer with the university. I know that it is necessarily opaque,” Ashlock says. “The desire is to be transparent and it can’t be because it is not allowed. A lot of students who were feeling served by the fuller staffing are really genuinely disappointed and hurt by the sudden staffing change.” </p>
					<p>Ashlock and his office stress the importance of misinformation not being spread about the current staffing change. To Ashlock, it is important to have the trust of the community and create a more inclusive environment. He says that the RCSGD and new programs such as the new orientation are, “One piece of a broader framework to contribute to a more inclusive campus community, not just for the LGBTQ community, but for everyone.” <span class="end">&#9737;</span></p>

					<h3>Biden's Surprise Visit to UC Santa Barbara</h3>
					<h4>BY: DYLAN LYMAN / Oct. 21, 2017</h4>
					<p><em>Former Vice President Joe Biden made an unplanned,</em> spontaneous visit to UC Santa Barbara’s Campbell Hall on Saturday, where students were watching a live broadcast of his speech at the Arlington Theater in Santa Barbara. The decision to come to Campbell Hall and talk to students there was a surprise to both students and organizers but many later said they thought it was in his character to do so.</p>
					<p>The announcement of Biden’s arrival came after a two-hour speech he made for the UCSB Arts and Lectures program which funds many speakers, arts events and lectures on campus and in the community. Students at Campbell Hall received Biden’s arrival with cheer and admiration. Many waited the long, anxious hour to see him. In his speech, he spoke on issues centered around operating in the world after college, keeping high hopes for the future, and his personal triumphs and failures.</p>
					<p>Tickets for the event were expensive and were sold in a lottery. Many students at the university were not able to attend due to high prices and bad luck, and so attended the simulcast at Campbell Hall.</p>
					<p>“We were given a heads up by a friend who works at Arts and Lectures and we still weren’t able to get a ticket,” said Erin Fitzsimmons, a fourth year History major.</p>
					<p>“Some tickets were sold at upwards of a hundred dollars,” said Kyra Prise, production manager for the event.</p>
					<p>The Arts and Lectures program hosted the live broadcast of the speech free for UCSB students only at Campbell Hall. It was funded through the use of student fees that all UCSB students pay. The Arts and Lectures program is run with funding from the Associated Students of UCSB which receive those student fees.</p>
					<p>“It was nice for Arts and Lectures to give us something for the fees,” said Edith de la Cruz, a fourth year Art History major.</p>
					<p>Biden spoke of what he considers is the “breakdown of the political institution,” referring to the current Trump administration’s conservative agenda and the rise of the alt-right. During his speech, Biden made many calls for action by the millennial generation, citing his own experience in college and his early political career in the 1960’s as a time similar to today.</p>
					<p>Biden’s speech was full of inspiring, uplifting statements aimed towards the millennial generation—particularly current college students. “The millennial generation is the most educated, tolerant and technologically advanced,” he said, adding he is “most hopeful” for this generation to “remake” the United States. He urged the current generation to get engaged.</p>
					<p>De la Cruz said listing to Biden helped quell her anxieties about entering the world after college. “[Biden’s speech] was very inspirational and patriotic, it felt good especially because we are graduating,” she said.</p>
					<p>Many students expressed excitement when the former Vice President decided to make a special visit to the hall. After the broadcast was over some left but about half decided to wait the hour for him to arrive.</p>
					<p>“I would picture him as a person who wants to come meet with [the students],” said De la Cruz about the decision for Biden to visit.</p>
 					<p>After a security sweep by the Secret Service, the former Vice President came out on the Campbell Hall stage and proceeded to make his way down to the floor, pacing between the rows of eager students.</p>
	 				<p>“I have about 15 minutes for a few yes or no questions,” Biden told the group of students. The private talk ended up lasting two hours, during which he continued his string of personal anecdotes and responded to many of the students’ questions.</p>
					<p>Many students got a handshake, high-five or hug from the former Vice President. He made sure that he met the people who wanted to meet him.</p>
					<p>“We were all waving to him, waiting outside near the back of the venue and [Biden] saw. So, he got out of the car and came to meet us all,” said Kyra Prise, of the Instructional Services Department. The department was hired to operate the cameras and sound to broadcast to Campbell Hall on UCSB’s campus.</p>
					<p>Prise worked as the camera operator at Arlington Theatre where Biden made his speech. “It was in [Biden’s] character to come and see the people at the simulcast,” she said.  “It really speaks to Arts and Lectures’ and the school’s mission and what Joe Biden is all about.”</p>
					<p>The surprise talk at Campbell Hall was only open to students who attended the live simulcast and no one was allowed to enter the hall after the announcement was made. Everyone in the hall was urged not text or call friends about it due to security concerns. <span class="end">&#9737;</span></p>

					<h3>Movie Review: <em>The Disaster Artist</em></h3>
					<h4>BY: DYLAN LYMAN // Dec. 12, 2017</h4>
					<p><em>“You have to be the best. The best, Greg,”</em> says Tommy Wiseau played by James Franco, but is the “The Disaster Artist” the best? Does James Franco make the best movie about a bad one? Or does it fall flat—a movie that is just as confused as the movie it’s about?</p>
					<p>Confused. That is the perfect word to describe the making of the cult classic movie, “The Room.” The production of the movie is written about in Greg Sestero’s memoir on his experiences living and being on set with Tommy Wiseau, who is the director, producer, writer and star of the movie.</p>
					<p>That memoir is titled “The Disaster Artist,” and James Franco directs and stars in the film adaptation of the same name. Along with his younger brother Dave Franco, and friend, Seth Rogen, Franco creates a masterpiece tragicomic movie about Wiseau and Sestero’s journey to create the worst movie ever made.</p>
					<p>That movie, “The Room,” is entertaining for its unbelievably incomprehensible and disparate, unresolved subplots.  The movie’s star, Tommy Wiseau, is just as arbitrary, awkward, and incomprehensible as the character he plays. His influence is seen throughout the movie’s cast and artistic direction. Scenes and lines are awkwardly shot and delivered.</p>
					<p>“The Room” was released on June 27, 2003 to an almost non-existent reception. It saw only $1,900 at the box office and was picked up by only one theatre because Wiseau paid for it to be there. Famously, a billboard sat on Highland Drive in Hollywood for years advertising the movie that nobody knew anything about. </p>
					<p>The film eventually gained a cult following, much to the likes of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” Sestero recalls the only people who showed up to watch it were college students, who would throw spoons at the screen and laugh at the acting.</p>
					<p>The reaction was not what Wiseau had originally intended for his film. To him, it was a retelling of his life story, a serious take on loneliness and betrayal. To everyone else it was a joke, something that was entertaining because it was bad.</p>
					<p>Franco’s adaptation of Sestero’s memoir. “The Disaster Artist,” is as comedic as it is tragic. Franco is by far no stranger to acting, starring in countless films, from “Freaks and Geeks” to “Pineapple Express,” to “This Is the End,” many of which were filmed with his friend, Seth Rogen. The duo has created some masterpieces of comedy, as well as some flops (i.e. “Sausage Party”).</p>
					<p>According to Rogen, Franco was inspired to make the adaptation because he felt he connected with Wiseau. Franco saw that some of his own works were not received as intended and empathized with Wiseau.</p>
					<p>This empathy translates well into “The Disaster Artist.” Franco depicts a tragic hero, a man who wants to see his dreams come to fruition, but is constantly denied that opportunity. In face of denial Wiseau—a wealthy man—decides to fund his own movie under his own direction. He decides to star in the movie as the main character along with his friend and roommate, Greg Sestero.</p>
					<p>The story of Tommy Wiseau is tragic because he is lonely and depressed. His only friend is Sestero, a man who is much younger than Wiseau. They decide to move to Los Angeles together to pursue their shared dream of becoming actors.</p>
					<p>In Los Angeles, Sestero finds moderate success as an actor while Wiseau is constantly denied. In a fit of depression, Wiseau decides he is going to make his own movie with the help of Sestero.</p>
					<p>In production, Wiseau becomes delusional, while Sestero sees the film falling apart. The tension between Wiseau and Sestero finds itself paralleled in their respective characters’ relationship in their movie.</p>
					<p>The Franco brothers are a well casted duo, on screen they have chemistry that makes a seemingly unlikely friendship seem plausible. The Franco brother’s portrayal walks a fine line between mocking the ridiculous persona of Wiseau while still respecting the underlying tragedy of his life. James Franco even stayed in person as Tommy Wiseau throughout the production of the movie. </p>
					<p>“The Disaster Artist” is a homage for people who believe in the genius of Tommy Wiseau. For those who are fans of James Franco, this movie is an entertaining comedy, one that, unlike his other movies, has a tragic serious side. Whether you have watched “The Room” or not, “The Disaster Artist” is a story of overcoming all odds, being an outsider, and making your dreams come true. It is about being yourself and at its heart shows the true meaning of art. It truly is a great movie about a bad one. <span class="end">&#9737;</span></p>
